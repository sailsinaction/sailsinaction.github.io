        <b>Chapter 3 - </b>We'll start building Brushfire in chapter 3. Since this is the beginning of the project there is no starting GitHub repo to clone. Chapter 3 does have an ending repo named <a href="https://github.com/sailsinaction/brushfire-ch3-end">brushfire-ch3-end</a>. So if you want to see what Brushfire should look like at the end of chapter 3, clone this repo. 
      </div> 

      <div class="regular-text"> 
        <b>Chapter 4 - </b>In chapter 4, we've added assets to Brushfire for the start of chapter 4. Therefore, it's necessary to clone the chapter 4 repo named <a href="https://github.com/sailsinaction/brushfire-ch4-start">brushfire-ch4-start</a> before starting the chapter. Similar to chapter 3, chapter 4 also has an ending GitHub repo named <a href="https://github.com/sailsinaction/brushfire-ch4-end">brushfire-ch4-end</a>. If you'd like to see what the project looks like by the end of chapter 4 or you want to use it for the start of chapter 5, clone this repo.
      </div>

      <div class="regular-text">
        <b>Chapter 5 - </b>We haven't added any assets for the start of chapter 5. Therefore, if you completed chapter 4 you can continue to the next chapter with that project. If you want to start chapter 5 without completing chapter 4, make sure you clone the <a href="https://github.com/sailsinaction/brushfire-ch4-end">brushfire-ch4-end</a> first.

      <div class="regular-text"> 
        <b>Chapter 6 - </b>In chapter 6, we've added assets to Brushfire for the start of chapter 6.

Chapter 6 also has an ending GitHub repo named <a href="https://github.com/sailsinaction/brushfire-ch6-end">brushfire-ch6-end</a>.

Chapter 8 also has an ending GitHub repo named <a href="https://github.com/sailsinaction/brushfire-ch8-end">brushfire-ch8-end</a>.
